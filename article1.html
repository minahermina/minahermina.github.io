                            <p>Nine months ago, I knew nothing about Linux. I decided I wanted to learn what Linux is and why so many people talk about it as the ideal operating system. Finally, I used Ubuntu (the worst Linux distro ever, by the way).</p>

                            <h2>From Distro hopping to Arch Linux</h2>
                            <p>Ubuntu was my first foray into the world of Linux, but I soon got bitten by the distro hopping bug. So, I uninstalled Ubuntu and went searching for a distro with a stunning and flashy interface that offered a variety of desktop environments to play with, like Gnome or KDE Plasma.</p>

                            <p>Ugh, something just wasn't right. Was this fancy interface really all Linux had to offer? It felt like there was this whole other side of Linux everyone was talking about, something deeper. I just didn't feel it. So, I kept exploring different distros, until I found the one that truly spoke to me: 
                                <a
                                    href="https://archlinux.org/"
                                    target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                >Arch Linux</a>.
                                Let's just say, I'm a total Arch convert now!</p> </section>

                            <h2>Why Arch Linux?</h2>
                            <p>Seeing many Linux users running Arch Linux impressed me! They configure every piece of software to their specific needs. Is this level of customization even possible on any operating system? Is there a level of control like this over any existing operating system?</p>

                            <p>One more thing I love about Arch Linux is its rolling release model. This means you install your system initially and then the system receives updates once they are reviewed by the maintainers (My current system can last for 100 years unless the laptop is broken into 2 halves!). Isn't this a insane advantage? There's no evil company enforcing updates to the latest version of a potentially vulnerable system.</p>

                            <p>I finally installed Arch Linux, but I was surprised. I had to configure everything from scratch, even connecting to Wi-Fi, which I did through the terminal with a bunch of commands. (Luckily, I later discovered it can actually be done with just one command!). I can't even launch any GUI app. I must install a desktop environment to manage these types of GUI apps.</p>

                            <h2>DWM and Suckless</h2>
                            <p>After searching for a desktop environment or program to manage my GUI applications, I was drawn to dwm (dynamic window manager). Unlike the window management system used in Windows, dwm is a tiling window manager that arranges windows side-by-side and allows control entirely through keyboard shortcuts. It was made by a group of programmers called Suckless. They develop software that suck less.</p>

                            <p>What I liked about dwm in particular is the control it offers, the philosophy behind it, and the fact that it's written in C.</p>

                            <p>It's configured through its source code! This means that whenever you want to make a configuration change, you edit the config.h file and then compile the program. (Don't worry, compilation and installation only take about 3 seconds and takes only one command!) .</p>

                            <div class="code-block">
                                <code>sudo make install clean  # Your dwm with its new config is compiled and installed !!</code>
                            </div>

                            <p>I thought, "What if I read the source code?" This could be a fantastic opportunity to learn C programming, understand how these projects are created, and see how these great programmers develop these masterpieces.</p>

                            <h2>DWM source code and Xorg server</h2>
                            <p>Despite my experience with C++, I dove into the dwm source code with limited knowledge of C's deep details.</p>

                            <p>I noticed something in the source code: dwm was managing windows by communicating with something called the 
                                "<a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/Xserver.1.xhtml">Xorg server</a>" 
                                or
                                "<a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/Xserver.1.xhtml">Xorg server</a>".
                            </p>

                            <p>The X server is a program that provides the foundation for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) on Linux systems. It handles low-level tasks like drawing windows, managing the keyboard and mouse, and displaying graphics on the screen.</p>

                            <p>In our case, dwm acts as the window manager, while the Xorg server handles graphics management. When dwm needs to draw a window, it sends a request to the X server specifying the desired window properties.</p>

                            <p>so dwm is an <b> X-client</b> that sends requests to the X server.</p>

                            <h2>Why bother with all these details?</h2>
                            <p>Don't you realize how powerful studying the window manager has been? This seemingly simple program, with its focused purpose, has given me a deeper understanding of my system's inner workings, customization options, graphics rendering, and overall Linux usage.</p>

                            <p>Studying the dwm taught me the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The deep details of C programming language.</li>
                                <li>How the <b> X server </b> functions and manages graphics in Linux.</li>
                                <li>How the 
                                    <b> <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html"> make</a> </b>
                                    utility compiles and manages multi-file projects, including the inner workings of 
                                    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Makefiles" > Makefiles</a>.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>You have the source code! The possibilities for customization and control are endless. With the ability to tailor the program's behavior to my exact needs through source code editing, you are the Master of your own System. The sky is the limit.</p>

                            <p>Using Arch Linux, Suckless tools and Linux has turned me into someone who's deeply interested in understanding the inner workings of Linux.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The choice is yours: take control of your system and unlock its full potential, or let a company manipulate your experience, system or even data.</p>
